I hate submodules. Avoid them.

## Git Remotes

This is a monorepo with two remotes:

### `origin` (private) - DEFAULT
- URL: git@github.com:thejaminator/latteries_private_mono.git
- Push everything here (including `example_scripts/private/`)
- This is the default remote for most operations

### `public` (public repo)
- URL: git@github.com:thejaminator/latteries.git
- Manually managed - do NOT push here unless explicitly asked
- EXCLUDE `example_scripts/private/` folder when pushing to public

## Common Commands

```bash
# Push to private (default)
git push origin main

# First time push to private (sets upstream)
git push -u origin main

# Push to public (only when explicitly asked, exclude private folder)
git push public main
```
